## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js

### What I learned

This project help me to get more comfortable in creating the frontend design for desktop view along with the mobile view using Next.js framework. I am creating the code for the desktop view first before adding the view for mobile. As I was viewing the changes through Firefox browser till the end, I just noticed that the design becomes weird again when viewed in Microsoft Edge browser.
However, this time I am getting the hang of using div tag attributes such as flex and everything else. Moreover, I think this time I created the frontend design without much attributes that I don't know what the use for.


### Continued development

I would like to investigate more on how to make the design consistent in whatever browser is used. Moreover, I  would like to use the json data next time to ma eke the page as "dynamic" rather than hard coding.
