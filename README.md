## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js

### What I learned

In this project I learned to style both desktop view and mobile view in one go using the ```sm md lg``` screen breakpoint. It is still confusing but I think I started to get the hang of it.


### Continued development

I would like to change several things such as the smaller price that is should be in a different position and make it more responsive when viewed through a different browser.
